# Midterm Report and Presentation

## Project Details
This project will take in users' stocks and dollar amounts invested and analyze the stocks to predict future value and assess the stocks' risk according to volatility. Using the volatility score, a same-sector stock will be suggested for each holding, and future value will be predicted based on historic data for the current portfolio and the risk-averse portfolio.

## How to Use Project
1. Use the `makefile` to install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` and set up the virtual environment.

## What We Will Do
At the midpoint, we have a good foundation of what we want the final app to look like. Now that we have a good understanding of accessing data through `yfinance`, which we can use to make models and add features from, we aim to improve the accuracy of our models to create the most useful tool. We have promising preliminary results but need to run these models on testing data to ensure they are appropriately fit. Adding these new features to create more metrics on the portfolio is the goal—while ensuring that the process for validating and fine-tuning these models is smooth.
